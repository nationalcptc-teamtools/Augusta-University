To add an entry to the /etc/hosts file to map an IP address to a domain (like GitHub), you'll need to edit the file with root privileges. Here are the steps to do this:

Open a Terminal: Open a terminal on your computer. On most Linux distributions, you can find the terminal in the applications menu or by searching for "Terminal" in the applications list.

Open /etc/hosts in a Text Editor with Root Privileges: Use a text editor with root privileges (like sudo nano or sudo vi) to edit the /etc/hosts file. For example:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/hosts
Add the Entry: Add a new line at the end of the file in the following format:

plaintext
Copy code
[IP Address]  [GitHub domain]
Replace [IP Address] with the IP address you want to map to GitHub (e.g., 192.30.255.112 for GitHub), and [GitHub domain] with the domain you want to map (e.g., github.com).

Example:

plaintext
Copy code
192.30.255.112  github.com
Save and Exit: Save the file and exit the text editor.

Flush DNS Cache (optional): If necessary, you can flush your DNS cache to ensure the changes take effect immediately.

On Linux, you can usually flush the DNS cache by restarting the network service or rebooting your system:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart network-manager   # for systemd-based systems
Test the Entry: Open a web browser and enter the GitHub domain you mapped in the /etc/hosts file (e.g., github.com). It should resolve to the IP address you specified.

Remember, modifying the /etc/hosts file can affect your system's DNS resolution, so use this approach carefully and only for legitimate purposes.
